      <p className="manifesto"><strong>Time is the most important asset.</strong> Time does not equal money. <strong>Time equals life.</strong> And you only have one chance to make it right. <strong>Every human being is fighting a battle inside themselves.</strong> It’s your <strong>obligation to help</strong> and inspire them. Regardless of what you do, you can always inspire others to do good. Nobody is better than you. <strong>And you’re not better than anybody else.</strong> Be humble. Being in the <strong>comfort zone is wonderful</strong>, but nothing ever grows there. Keep studying. <strong>Keep creating.</strong> Haters will come if you have the <strong>audacity to build something new</strong>. Don’t let them define you. <strong>Don’t let them stop you.</strong> Just block them and keep going. Don’t expect <strong>others to make you happy</strong>. You are the only one <strong>responsible for your happiness</strong>. Don’t wait until friday to enjoy life. Joy should be present in everything you do. <strong>Be kind to your parents</strong>. They gave up many things for you. Having hundreds of <strong>people admiring you</strong> is worthless, if you’re not admired by your own family. Don’t fear the unknown. Fear knowing everything. <strong>Life is too damn short</strong> and every day counts. <strong>Do what you wanna do</strong> and do it now.  Tick-tock don't stop. Tick-tock don't wait.</p>
